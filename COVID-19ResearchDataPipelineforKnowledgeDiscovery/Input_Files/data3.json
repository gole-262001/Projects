Accordingly, MDD in elite sports has received somewhat more attention in recent years than before, as some prominent, tragic cases have come to public attention. Nevertheless, MDD and depressive symptoms often remain a taboo subject in the world of sports.",

The prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder among elite athletes is reported to be between 6% [7] and 14.6% [8] . It is higher in injured athletes, and females are more severely affected than males [1, 9] . In general, anxiety symptoms appear to be at least as frequent in athletes as in the general population [1] . For depression, there is no consensus, as the literature provides a wide range between 4% [7] and 68% [10] of athletes with depressive symptoms. Sleep disturbances and disorders are also common in competitive sports [3, 11] . Moreover, they represent a major risk factor for various other mental health disorders, such as depression [12] [13] [14] [15] , and have a negative effect on physical performance [16, 17] .",

The lockdown included the closure of shops, public facilities (e.g., restaurants, universities, leisure and sports facilities) and people were advised to stay at home. Individual sportive activities were still possible during the lockdown, although all sport facilities were closed until the 11 May 2020. Thus, such measures represented a break in the lives of athletes, as, from one day to the next, massive restrictions were implemented with regard to their daily habits [20] .",

An increase in pre-existing symptoms has been described as well as new psychiatric symptoms in people experiencing stress, anxiety or grief as a result of the pandemic [24] . Social distancing and quarantine can have an additional detrimental impact on mental health [25] . Elite athletes have been faced with specific restrictions in their daily habits imposed by lockdown measures, some of which go beyond those of the general public. They were even confronted with the postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics, leading to increased stress and uncertainty as many athletes' plans and schedules were disrupted [26] . Sports competitions abruptly stopped when COVID-19 cases were detected. Daily training routines that had been established over years were suddenly no longer possible. Depending on their sport (i.e., team vs. individual sports, summer vs. winter sports) and the season in which the lockdown was imposed, the routines of athletes were affected differently. An increased mental health burden in elite football players and athletes of other disciplines has already been described during the lockdown period in spring 2020 [20, [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

All explanatory variables that had an association with the independent variables at p < 0.20 in the univariable analyses were included in the multivariable-adjusted analyses. Using a stepwise backward elimination process, the least significant variables were then removed from the base model. Only variables with p < 0.05 remained in the final parsimonious model.

This might be explained by the fact that cancelled competitions deprived athletes of the public stage and of direct income, such as prize money. It is difficult to find an explanation for the greater financial existential fears among winter sports athletes as they had almost finished their season before the first lockdown, and, thus, their actual income was only marginally affected. From a pure speculative point of view, a potential reason might be the fact that in our sample, winter sports athletes had significantly fewer additional occupations. This would leave them without additional income to compensate for reduced income from sport. Another hypothetical explanation could be that some athletes performed below their expectations last season, which may have led to financial concerns for the future.",

The same explanation may apply for the finding that higher training volume during the lockdown is associated with more financial existential fears: the less they train the more time they have to work or to study. The lower performance capacity in team sports could be explained by the fact that in team sports, creating regular training situations was impossible during the lockdown.",

The higher prevalence of depression in females is well known and can be confirmed in our sample [1, 45] . In particular, female athletes with low socio-economic status and poor training conditions seem to suffer from especially severe psychological symptoms during lockdown [20] . A robust body of evidence shows strong associations between depression and anxiety [46] as well as depression and sleep disturbance [47] . Thus, the corresponding correlations found in this study are entirely compatible with the current state of knowledge. The association of depressive symptoms with lower training intensity and personal coping with the measures taken by the authorities is also plausible. The time freed up by less training can lead to doubts and perhaps a crisis of purpose. Poor coping with the lockdown measures is in itself a stressor. Since changes in training habits enforced by the lockdown seem to be a psychological stressor, normal training should be maintained as usual, as far as the measures allow. A negative correlation between physical activity level and mental health symptoms during the pandemic has also been shown before [48] . Combining workouts with online meetings (for team and individual athletes) could also be an opportunity to support mental health during such periods, as social support has been shown to be a protective factor for mental health in athletes in general [31] .",

A clinical diagnosis of mental disorders cannot be made and no conclusions can be drawn as to whether psychiatric treatment is indicated. Secondly, data concerning the pre-lockdown period were queried retrospectively, which increases the likelihood of biased information. Thirdly, the recruited sample may not be entirely representative of elite athletes in Switzerland, and external validity could be limited as selection bias may have occurred. Fourth, for a better interpretation of our results it would have been helpful to have a control sample with the same variables during normal times. Fifth, the number of participants limits the finding of highly significant observations regarding differences between subgroups. However, as it is difficult to find larger collectives of elite athletes, this is nevertheless one of the larger studies reporting on the mental health of athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The initial lockdown measures represented a significant break in the daily routines of elite athletes, but prolonged, albeit less severe, restrictions during the pandemic may have a different psychiatric impact. Therefore, although the present study has not yet demonstrated alarmingly high rates of mental health symptoms, longitudinal studies during the pandemic should further investigate these developments as well as potential long-term effects so that appropriate therapeutic strategies can be developed if necessary. Such longitudinal studies could also be used to assess the effectiveness of preventive measures. Appropriate preventive measures could be, for example, psychoeducational measures in sports associations or direct access for athletes to the relevant professionals mediated by the association, as well as efforts to provide as normal training conditions as possible. Wherever possible, outpatient psychiatric consultations should additionally be offered virtually or by phone [50, 51] to ensure that everyone has access to psychiatric care despite quarantine rules. In this context, the WHO has also launched an initiative to improve access to mental health services for the general population worldwide [52] .
