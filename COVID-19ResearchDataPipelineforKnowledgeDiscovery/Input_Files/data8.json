Method: an integrative literature review. The PICO strategy was used to elaborate the question. The search was conducted in four databases: PubMed Sci Verse Scopus Web of Science and EMBASE considering any period of time. Results: a total of 32 studies were included from the 561 studies identified and they were presented in two categories: \"Conditions for reuse\" and \"Reprocessing the masks\". Of the evaluated research studies seven (21.8%) addressed the reuse of the N95 face respirator mask or equivalent and 25 (78.1%) evaluated different reprocessing methods namely: ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (14); hydrogen peroxide (8); vapor methods (14); using dry heat (5) and chemical methods (sodium hypochlorite [6] ethanol [4] and sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate and dimethyldioxirane [1]). We emphasize that different methods were used in one same article. Conclusion:",

A research study showed that only a small percentage (\u22640.21%) of viable virus was reaerosolized from the tested FRMs by the reverse air flow generated by simulated cough. The viruses applied as aerosols were much more susceptible to reaerosolization than those contaminated with droplets. Thus, the authors Rev. Latino-Am. Enfermagem 2021;29:e3492.",

The nanofiber FRMs were also thinner and lighter and presented slightly higher bacterial filtration efficiency than the other masks evaluated (58) .",

Thus, as new respiratory pathogens emerge (at increased levels and/or of unknown virulence), there is a need for studies that focus on the possibility for reaerosolization. Future studies assessing the risks of prolonged use for the N95 mask should consider factors such as microbial load, stability of the organism in the environment, performance of the existing engineering controls, and exposure duration. Finally, there is also a need for studies focused on the improvement of mask designs that favor usability of the FRMs. We emphasize that more research studies are needed to obtain evidence, especially in real work environments for reusing and reprocessing FRMs, whether or not recommended. The evidence from this review is indeed timely to the pandemic time of COVID-19 that the world is facing. Reflecting and applying knowledge about reuse and reprocessing of FRMs can contribute to and enrich the health authorities' decisions. Safety in the health professionals' work is fundamental against a hightransmissibility pathogen capability like SARS-CoV-2.",
